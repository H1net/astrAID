              Astra's Story
            </h2>
            <div className="prose max-w-none">
              <p>
                AstrAID was born from a deeply personal journey with our beloved
                rescue dog, Astra. When we first welcomed Astra into our home,
                she was struggling with severe anxiety, fear-based reactivity,
                and medical challenges that made traditional training approaches
                ineffective.
              </p>
              
              <p className="my-4">
                Despite consulting with multiple trainers and veterinary
                behaviorists, we found ourselves overwhelmed by conflicting
                advice and training methodologies. What worked for most dogs
                didn't seem to help Astra's unique situation.
              </p>
              
              <p className="my-4">
                The turning point came when we began using AI to help us research,
                organize, and personalize training techniques specifically for
                Astra's needs. By combining expert knowledge with AI-assisted
                planning and consistent documentation, we were able to create a
                tailored approach that finally helped Astra overcome her
                challenges.
              </p>
              
              <p className="my-4">
                Today, Astra is a confident, happy dog who has made remarkable
                progress. Her journey inspired us to create AstrAIDâ€”a platform
                that combines expert canine training knowledge with the
                personalized assistance of AI to help other pet owners facing
                similar challenges.
